A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the otherCNN (Convolutional Neural Network or ConvNet) is a type of feed-forward artificial network where the connectivity pattern between its neurons is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex. The visual cortex has a small region of cells that are sensitive to specific regions of the visual field.Convolutional neural networks are multi-layer neural networks that are really good at getting the features out of data. They work well with images and they don't need a lot of pre-processing. Using convolutions and pooling to reduce an image to its basic features, you can identify images correctly.A convolution converts all the pixels in its receptive field into a single value. For example, if you would apply a convolution to an image, you will be decreasing the image size as well as bringing all the information in the field together into a single pixel. The final output of the convolutional layer is a vector.Convolutional neural network (or CNN) is a special type of multilayer neural network or deep learning architecture inspired by the visual system of living beings. The CNN is very much suitable for different fields of computer vision and natural language processing.Artificial Intelligence has been witnessing a monumental growth in bridging the gap between the capabilities of humans and machines. Researchers and enthusiasts alike, work on numerous aspects of the field to make amazing things happen. One of many such areas is the domain of Computer Vision.

The agenda for this field is to enable machines to view the world as humans do, perceive it in a similar manner and even use the knowledge for a multitude of tasks such as Image & Video recognition, Image Analysis & Classification, Media Recreation, Recommendation Systems, Natural Language Processing, etc. The advancements in Computer Vision with Deep Learning has been constructed and perfected with time, primarily over one particular algorithm â€” a Convolutional Neural Network.A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics.

The architecture of a ConvNet is analogous to that of the connectivity pattern of Neurons in the Human Brain and was inspired by the organization of the Visual Cortex. Individual neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the Receptive Field. A collection of such fields overlap to cover the entire visual area.The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms.

So why not just flatten the image (e.g. 3x3 image matrix into a 9x1 vector) and feed it to a Multi-Level Perceptron for classification purposes? Uh.. not really.

In cases of extremely basic binary images, the method might show an average precision score while performing prediction of classes but would have little to no accuracy when it comes to complex images having pixel dependencies throughout.

A ConvNet is able to successfully capture the Spatial and Temporal dependencies in an image through the application of relevant filters. The architecture performs a better fitting to the image dataset due to the reduction in the number of parameters involved and reusability of weights. In other words, the network can be trained to understand the sophistication of the image better.
